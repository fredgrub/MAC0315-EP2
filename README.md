# Revised simplex method
Implementation of the two-phase Revised Simplex method using the Octave language. The code was developed for EP2 and 3 of the discipline MAC0315 - Linear Optimization.

# What is the revised simplex method?
A linear programming problem is a mathematical problem that can be expressed in the following general form:

$$\begin{align}
\text{minimize} \quad & c^T x \\
\text{subject to} \quad & Ax = b \\ 
& x \geq 0 \end{align}
$$

where $x$ is a vector of decision variables, $c$ is the cost vector, $A$ is the constraint matrix, and $b$ is the right-hand side vector.

The revised simplex method is an algorithm used to solve linear programming problems. It is an extension of the simplex method, which is the most popular algorithm for solving linear programming problems. The revised simplex method is more efficient than the simplex method, and is used in many commercial software packages for solving linear programming problems.
